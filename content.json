    "about": [" <p>Ocean water pollution is a serious problem that is caused by harmful things getting into Earth’s",
    " oceans. These things are usually thrown, dumped or flow into the ocean instead of being taken care",
    " of properly. They can come from many different sources such as people littering, factories or",
    " boats. When the ocean water becomes polluted with plastic and chemicals it can cause harm to the",
    " plants and animals that live there. This also makes the water dirty and unsafe for humans to use",
    " for drinking, eating and playing.</p><br>",

    " <p>Ocean water pollution has many negative effects on the ocean ecosystem. The pollutants can harm or",
    " kill the sea creatures such as fish, turtles, dolphins and many more ocean creatures. Sometimes the",
    " creatures in the ocean mistake rubbish for food and attempt to eat it which leads to them becoming",
    " very sick. Pollution in the ocean can also kill a lot of marine plants such as coral and algae",
    " which are underwater habits for many animals and help to produce a lot of the Earth’s oxygen. When",
    " these plants are in unclean water or have their sunlight blocked by floating rubbish they can",
    " disrupt the balance of the ocean around them making it harder for animals to survive.</p><br>",

    " <p>It is important for all of us to take action when we can to help keep the ocean clean and spread",
    " awareness about the issues that are related to unclean oceans. This can be begun by being mindful",
    " of how our waste is disposed of both at home and in other places. We can also try to use less",
    " plastic and reuse other items when possible. When we see litter around we can quickly pick it up",
    " and put it into a bin to stop it from entering the environment and the ocean. By all doing our part",
    " we can work together to make a big difference and make the world a better place.</p>"],

    "causes": [" <p>One of the major concerns in ocean water pollution is plastic entering the ocean. Plastic items",
    " like bags, bottles and packaging often end up in the ocean when they are not treated properly on",
    " land or bought when they are not needed. By not discarding plastic waste properly there is a very",
    " high chance that it will either end up in the environment or in waterways. Once in waterways, it",
    " will often be carried out to sea where it will stay for many years. Using bins to throw away",
    " plastic waste will help to reduce the amount that ends up in waterways.</p><br>",
    
    " <p>Microplastics are an indirect problem that is caused by plastic waste in the ocean. While they are",
    " small and seem harmless they cause really big problems for animals and humans. They are created",
    " when bigger pieces of plastic break down due to the elements into smaller pieces. These smaller",
    " pieces then are in the water and can be drunk by animals or humans which can make them very sick.",
    " Some products also contain microplastics in them. To reduce the amount of microplastics in the",
    " ocean you can make sure to not use products that contain them and to also ensure you properly",
    " dispose of waste.</p><br>",
    
    " <p>Plastic utensils are a smaller cause of plastic pollution but one that many of us can take part in",
    " to reduce the effect. Things like plastic straws, forks, knives and spoons along with plastic",
    " takeout containers are really bad for the environment. As they are typically used when getting food",
    " quickly to eat somewhere away from home a lot of the time there is no proper waste disposal nearby.",
    " Alternates like paper, wood and bamboo are good because they are not harmful to the environment.",
    " Also getting reusable utensils or saying no to getting utensils from restaurants when you know you",
    " don’t need them can have a positive impact.</p><br>",
    
    " <p>The fishing industry is also a really big contributor to ocean water pollution. If any of their",
    " gear breaks out at sea or gets stuck on the bottom of the ocean it is cheaper for them to just",
    " leave it in the ocean and get a new one than to try and recover it. Proper disposal of fishing",
    " equipment and making sure to buy from suppliers that care about the environment can drastically",
    " reduce the amount of pollution in the ocean due to fishing companies.</p><br>",
    
    " <p>Waste management in general is also a massive issue. Australia does pretty well with waste",
    " management but other countries in the world do not have good systems in place which leads to a lot",
    " of waste that can be recycled not being recycled and other waste being handled poorly and ending up",
    " in the environment. Governments and businesses can incorporate policies and practices that use more",
    " sustainable materials and dispose of waste through better sources leading to a reduction in",
    " pollution.</p><br>"],

    "effects": [" <p>Ocean water pollution is very bad for all marine life. Animals will mistake the plastic pollution",
    " in the ocean for food and it will cause them to become sick. Other plastic pollution such as",
    " fishing gear can cause marine life to be stuck until they eventually die of starvation. Plastic",
    " pollution in the ocean disrupts the marine ecosystem, those natural habitats and the food chains in",
    " this ecosystem leading to an imbalance in biodiversity which can cause other problems.</p><br>",
    
    " <p>There are many negative impacts related to human health from ocean water pollution. As more",
    " pollution enters the ocean and breaks down into microplastics, more of the water we drink contains",
    " microplastics. The animals that are in the ocean are already being found to have much higher levels",
    " of microplastics inside of them than 10 years ago. Around 1/3 of the world relies on seafood for",
    " their protein and as this slowly contains higher levels of microplastics more people are beginning",
    " to become sick.</p><br>",
    
    " <p>The ecosystems themselves can be disrupted by there being plastic pollution in the ocean. Coral",
    " reefs, kelp and areas of dense algae all provide food and shelter for many of the ocean's wildlife.",
    " The plants will lose access to sunlight due to floating debris and the coral can become covered in",
    " pollution. As these plants are essential to the ecosystems, once they begin to die the whole",
    " ecosystem around them also begins to fall apart.</p><br>",
    
    " <p>While many people think that ocean water pollution just affects the water and the animals that live",
    " there, most people are not aware of the larger issue which is that the ocean produces at least 50%",
    " of the Earth’s oxygen. This poses a much bigger risk than many people know of and this is why ocean",
    " water pollution is one of the main problems we need to deal with in the world currently. Lower",
    " oxygen levels will land ecosystems beginning to struggle and a decrease in the world’s air quality.</p><br>"],

    "contribute": [" <p>One of the best things that you can do to make a difference is to follow the three R’s. Reduce,",
    " Reuse, Recycle. Reducing is when you decide that you don’t need that item so you choose not to get",
    " it. This can be things like wanting the latest model of something when your current one works fine.",
    " Reusing is deciding to use something you already have, such as a water bottle or food container",
    " instead of throwing it out and getting a new one. If you have plastic waste that you can’t reuse",
    " then you can recycle it. Check the label on the piece of plastic to find out if it can be recycled",
    " in your local area. Lots of plastic bottles can be recycled with the return and earn scheme.</p><br>",
    
    " <p>Saying “no” to unneeded plastic items such as plastic straws when you are out can help to reduce",
    " the amount of plastic ending up in the ocean and becoming a danger to marine life. Instead, you can",
    " carry around a reusable straw or just drink directly from the cup. Every time you say “no” to",
    " receiving a piece of plastic cutlery you are reducing the amount of plastic ending up in landfills",
    " and potentially the ocean.</p><br>",
    
    " <p>Public cleanups are a great way to help out the environment. Local communities such as your school",
    " or local council will periodically organise events where you clean up an area around you, sometimes",
    " it is a park or other times it is somewhere on the harbour. If there are no public cleanups in your",
    " area you can organise one through one of these communities. These cleanups help to keep the",
    " environment clean, display the problems with not disposing of waste properly and limit the amount",
    " of rubbish ending up in the ocean.</p><br>",
    
    " <p>One of the best things you can do, especially if you are younger is to educate others around you",
    " about the issue. By spreading awareness of the issue, more people will begin to make choices that",
    " have a more positive impact on the environment and will lead to less plastic making its way into",
    " the ocean. You can tell anyone you want about ocean water pollution even if you think they have",
    " already heard about it because they may need a reminder or you may have some information that they",
    " haven't heard yet.</p><br>"],
